# Metadata Schema (TODO)

> TODO: Populate this document with the stable JSON schema for `metadata.json` once implemented in Phase X (#PX-T3, #PX-T7).

This stub exists to anchor documentation updates required by the upcoming title-aware ripping work. Update with field definitions, data types, and an example payload when the metadata export is implemented.
