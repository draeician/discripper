# Final Release Audit

- **Scope**: Reviewed implementation across `src/`, automated scripts, and acceptance artifacts to confirm alignment with PRD requirements and coverage thresholds.
- **Verification**:
  - Tests and fixtures cover the documented scenarios (movie, series, ambiguous) with â‰¥80% coverage.
  - CLI pathways, configuration layering, and ripping pipeline behave as documented in `README.md` and `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`.
  - Safety guards (dry-run, device detection, non-destructive defaults) remain intact.
- **Issues**: None observed; repository is ready for handoff.

**Status**: PASS
