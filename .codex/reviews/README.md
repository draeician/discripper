# .codex/audit/

This directory stores **all audit reports and findings** generated by contributors operating in [Auditor Mode](../modes/AUDITOR.md). These reports document deep reviews of code, documentation, processes, and commit history, focusing on quality, security, performance, and maintainability.

Each audit file is saved with a random 8-hex hash prefix for traceability and uniqueness:

```
abcd1234-audit-summary.audit.md
```

## 📋 Guidelines

* All audits must be comprehensive — covering recent changes and historical context where relevant.
* Place each new audit report in this directory or the corresponding service’s `.codex/audit/` folder.
* Use the following filename convention: `<8hex>-<short-summary>.audit.md`.
* Include a clear **PASS** or **FAILED** status at the end of the report.
* Reference any related task files, commits, or PRs.
* Ensure all findings are actionable and specific.

## 🧠 Audit Scope

Auditors are expected to:

* Review all code and documentation relevant to a task or feature.
* Verify tests exist, pass, and cover all major paths.
* Look for security, performance, and maintainability risks.
* Identify repeated mistakes or ignored feedback.
* Ensure compliance with repository standards and style guides.
