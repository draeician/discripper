# .codex/reviews/

This directory stores **all review notes and findings** generated by contributors operating in [Reviewer Mode](../modes/REVIEWER.md). Reviews focus on keeping documentation current, identifying missing or outdated information, and surfacing discrepancies that require new tasks.

Each review note file is saved with a random 8-hex hash prefix for traceability:

```
abcd1234-review-note.md
```

## 📋 Guidelines

* Place every new review note in this directory or the relevant service’s `.codex/reviews/` folder.
* Use the following filename convention: `<8hex>-<short-summary>.review-note.md`.
* Do **not** edit code or documentation directly — reviewers report findings only.
* For each discrepancy, generate a `TMT-<hash>-<description>.md` task file in `.codex/tasks/`.
* Reference all relevant documentation, commits, or audit files.
* Add links to related tasks or follow-ups where appropriate.

## 🧠 Reviewer Scope

Reviewers are expected to:

* Audit `.codex/` instructions, planning notes, and documentation for accuracy and currency.
* Check `.github/` workflows and configuration files for drift or staleness.
* Inspect top-level `README` files and service-level docs.
* Identify discrepancies and create follow-up tasks for Task Masters and Coders.
* Maintain `.codex/notes/reviewer-mode-cheat-sheet.md` with recurring preferences or reviewer guidelines.
