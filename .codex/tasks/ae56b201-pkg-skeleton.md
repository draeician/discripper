## Context
Lay down the base modules and namespaces so subsequent tasks can flesh out CLI and core logic without worrying about package wiring.

## Plan
- Add CLI module with placeholder `main()` returning a non-error status or message.
- Create `core` package directory with `__init__.py` prepared for future exports.
- Smoke-test imports to confirm the namespace is wired correctly.
